Difficulty: `Easy/Medium`

### Description

Develop a fun and interactive app where users input text, and it automatically translates the message into emoji-based sentences. The app will primarily use a predefined dictionary to map words or phrases to corresponding emojis. Users will also have the ability to tweak the emoji translations manually by selecting from a list of alternative emojis.

_Because sometimes, the right emoji speaks louder than words!_

Follow the steps below to complete this challenge:

1. Develop a simple user interface (UI) that allows users to input text (e.g., a sentence or phrase)
2. Create a predefined dictionary that maps common words or phrases to emojis
3. Once the user enters a sentence, break it down into individual words and replace the words that have corresponding emojis with the emojis
4. After the initial translation, allow users to manually tweak the suggested emojis by selecting from a list of alternative options
5. Also add a Voice-to-Emoji Translation with integrated voice recognition so that users can speak their sentences, and the app translates them into emojis in real-time. This will add a fun element to the app

Bonus Feature ( Optional ):

_Implementing the bonus feature will make the task count as `Medium`, otherwise it will be `Easy`_

1. Emoji Sentiment Analysis having an implementation of sentiment analysis using simple NLP models (like VADER or TextBlob) to adjust emoji suggestions based on the emotional tone of the text. This can help ensure the emoji translation better reflects the mood of the original message

### Expected Input and Output Examples:

`Input: "I love pizza"`

Output: "‚ù§Ô∏è üçï"

`Input: "The dog is happy"`

#### `Discord Bot`, `APIs`,`Full Stack Development`, `GenAI`, `CRUD`

Mentors: [Anush Revankar ](https://github.com/anushrevankar24) ([+91 9482597386](https://wa.me/9482597386)), [Ayush Kumar Singh](https://github.com/Ayush4345) ([+91 9334352548](https://wa.me/9334352548))

Discord is a popular communication platform used for communities, and Discord bots can automate tasks within these servers, enhancing server functionality. In this task, you are expected to build a Discord quiz bot that allows users to select from a set of 10-20 available quizzes, answer timed questions, and view their results on a leaderboard ranked by both points and time taken. In cases where multiple users have the same points, the ranking should be determined based on the time taken per question. After completing a quiz, users should be able to view the top 10 players and their overall rank.

The task also includes building a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing quiz sets and individual questions.

**Key Features to Implement**:
  1) **Discord Quiz Bot** :
        - The bot should display 10-20 available quizzes for users to choose from, with each quiz consisting of multiple-choice questions.
        - Once a quiz is selected, the bot presents each question one by one, with a set timer (e.g., 30 seconds per question). The bot will track the time users take 
         to answer each question
        - After the quiz, display a leaderboard ranking players.The leaderboard should display users ranked by their points (total number of correct answers). If 
          multiple users have the same points, the ranking should be decided based on time taken per question (faster users rank higher). 
        - The leaderboard should show the top 10 players and the user‚Äôs rank, even if they are not in the top 10.
       
  2)  **Quiz Management application**:
      - Create a web-based CRUD application (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage quiz sets and individual questions.
      - Through this panel, authorized admins can create quiz sets (e.g., 10 questions per set), update quiz sets or individual questions, and delete existing sets 
         or questions. Admins can also view all quiz sets and questions.
      - The CRUD application will be connected to the same database that the Discord quiz bot uses, ensuring real-time synchronization of changes made in the admin 
        panel with the questions displayed to users during quizzes.

### Bonus Features:
1. Enhance the quiz management application by integrating  Large Language Models (LLMs) through APIs like OpenAI (ChatGPT) or Gemini to generate quiz question sets. This feature allows admins or question setters to specify the number of questions needed (e.g., 10 questions per quiz), and the AI should generate that number of questions.The generated questions should be editable, allowing admins to review and modify any of the AI-generated questions before finalizing the quiz set.
2. Deploy the Discord Quizbot on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Vercel) so it can run continuously and be accessible to users.
