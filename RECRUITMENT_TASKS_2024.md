## Task ID: Example Task

#### `Natural Language Processing`, `Machine Learning`

Mentors: [John Doe](https://github.com/johndoe) ([+91 1234567890](https://wa.me/911234567890)), [Jane Smith](https://github.com/janesmith) ([+91 9876543210](https://wa.me/919876543210))

Difficulty: `Medium`

### Description

Build an AI-powered virtual assistant that can understand and respond to user queries in natural language. The assistant should be able to perform tasks such as answering questions, setting reminders, and providing recommendations.

Follow the steps below to complete this challenge:

1. Implement natural language processing to understand user input
2. Develop a knowledge base for the assistant to draw information from
3. Create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the assistant

### Useful resources:

- [Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.nltk.org/book/)
- [Building AI Assistants with TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)
- [Rasa: Open Source Conversational AI](https://rasa.com/)

### Tips

1. Start by focusing on a specific domain or set of tasks for your assistant
2. Use pre-trained models and APIs to accelerate development
3. Pay attention to the user experience and make interactions feel natural


## Task ID: Emojify

#### `Web Application`, `Natural Language Processing`

Mentors: [Apoorva Agrawal](https://github.com/imApoorva36) ([+91 8197404580](https://wa.me/8197404580)), [Mardav Gandhi](https://github.com/marcdhi) ([+91 9033398366](https://wa.me/9033398366))

Difficulty: `Easy/Medium`

### Description

Develop a fun and interactive app where users input text, and it automatically translates the message into emoji-based sentences. The app will primarily use a predefined dictionary to map words or phrases to corresponding emojis. Users will also have the ability to tweak the emoji translations manually by selecting from a list of alternative emojis.

_Because sometimes, the right emoji speaks louder than words!_

Follow the steps below to complete this challenge:

1. Develop a simple user interface (UI) that allows users to input text (e.g., a sentence or phrase)
2. Create a predefined dictionary that maps common words or phrases to emojis
3. Once the user enters a sentence, break it down into individual words and replace the words that have corresponding emojis with the emojis
4. After the initial translation, allow users to manually tweak the suggested emojis by selecting from a list of alternative options
5. Also add a Voice-to-Emoji Translation with integrated voice recognition so that users can speak their sentences, and the app translates them into emojis in real-time. This will add a fun element to the app

Bonus Feature ( Optional ):

_Implementing the bonus feature will make the task count as `Medium`, otherwise it will be `Easy`_
1. Emoji Sentiment Analysis having an implementation of sentiment analysis using simple NLP models (like VADER or TextBlob) to adjust emoji suggestions based on the emotional tone of the text. This can help ensure the emoji translation better reflects the mood of the original message

### Expected Input and Output Examples:

`Input: "I love pizza"`

Output: "‚ù§Ô∏è üçï"

`Input: "The dog is happy"`

Output: "üê∂ üòÉ"

### Useful resources:

- [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/)
- [Unicode Emoji List](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-list.html)
- [Python Speech Recognition Library](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
- [Sentiment Analysis Tool VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)
- [Sentiment Analysis NLP Library](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)
- [ReactJS](https://react.dev/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)

### Tips

1. Start by focusing on a basic set of words for translation and expand the emoji dictionary over time.
2. Make the UI fun and interactive with features like live emoji preview as the user types.
3. Consider using libraries or frameworks like React, Vue.js, or plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript for building the interface.
4. Allow flexibility in how emojis are displayed and edited, making the user experience more enjoyable.

### Task ID: Fast-Type

#### `Web Development`

Mentors: [Aahil Rafiq](https://github.com/AahilRafiq) ([+91 7975657621](https://wa.me/917975657621)), [Shree Harsha Bhat](https://github.com/mshreeharsha) ([+91 9739835034](https://wa.me/919739835034))

Difficulty: `Medium`

### Description

Build a typing speed test app like Monkeytype. The app should let users take a typing test based on either time (e.g., 60 seconds) or a fixed number of words (e.g., 50 words).

Include the following features:

1. Show the typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy after the test.
2. Provide analytics on the user's typing:
   - Speed and accuracy stats
   - A graph showing how typing speed changes over time during the test
3. Create a daily leaderboard and an all-time leaderboard to track the top typers.
4. **Bonus:** Show how a user's typing speed improves over time.
5. **Bonus:** Add a multiplayer mode where users can race with 5 random people online.

### Useful resources:

- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
- [SpeedTypingOnline (How to calculate WPM and accuracy)](https://www.speedtypingonline.com/typing-equations)
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)

### Tips

1. Start with a basic typing test that records speed and accuracy.
2. For leaderboards, use a simple database to store results and calculate rankings.
3. For the graph, use Chart.js to visualize typing speed over time.
