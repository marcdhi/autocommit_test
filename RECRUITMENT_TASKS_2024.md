#### `Natural Language Processing`, `Machine Learning`

Mentors: [John Doe](https://github.com/johndoe) ([+91 1234567890](https://wa.me/911234567890)), [Jane Smith](https://github.com/janesmith) ([+91 9876543210](https://wa.me/919876543210))

Difficulty: `Medium`

### Description

Build an AI-powered virtual assistant that can understand and respond to user queries in natural language. The assistant should be able to perform tasks such as answering questions, setting reminders, and providing recommendations.

Follow the steps below to complete this challenge:

1. Implement natural language processing to understand user input
2. Develop a knowledge base for the assistant to draw information from
3. Create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the assistant

### Useful resources:

- [Natural Language Processing with Python](https://www.nltk.org/book/)
- [Building AI Assistants with TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)
- [Rasa: Open Source Conversational AI](https://rasa.com/)

### Tips

1. Start by focusing on a specific domain or set of tasks for your assistant
2. Use pre-trained models and APIs to accelerate development
3. Pay attention to the user experience and make interactions feel natural

## Task ID: Discord QuizBot

#### `Discord Bot`, `APIs`,`Full Stack Development`, `GenAI`

Mentors: [Anush Revankar ](https://github.com/anushrevankar24) ([+91 9482597386](https://wa.me/9482597386)), [Ayush Kumar Singh](https://github.com/Ayush4345) ([+91 9334352548](https://wa.me/9334352548))

Difficulty: `Medium`

### Description
Discord is a popular communication platform used for communities, and Discord bots can automate tasks within these servers, enhancing server functionality. In this task, you are expected to build a Discord quiz bot that allows users to select from a set of 10-20 available quizzes, answer timed questions, and view their results on a leaderboard ranked by both points and time taken. In cases where multiple users have the same points, the ranking should be determined based on the time taken per question. After completing a quiz, users should be able to view the top 10 players and their overall rank.

The task also includes building a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing quiz sets and individual questions.

### Bonus Features:
1. Enhance the quiz management application by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, LLaMA) to automatically generate quiz question sets. This feature should allow admins or question setters to specify the number of questions needed (e.g., 10 questions per quiz), and the AI should generate that number of questions.The generated questions should be editable, allowing admins to review and modify any of the AI-generated questions before finalizing the quiz set.
2. Deploy the QuizMaster bot on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Vercel) so it can run continuously and be accessible to users.

- [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  
### Tips
1. Use any language, technology, or framework of your choice to build the bot and backend.
2. Start with quiz selection, timing, and leaderboard display before adding extra features.
3. Use Gemini API for integrating LLMs for making questions ,as its API is free to use.
4. Ensure intuitive commands, similar to MEE6, and add slash commands for easy interaction.
5. Any useful additional/interesting feature will have bonus points.
