## Task ID: Emojify

#### `Web Application`, `Natural Language Processing`

Mentors: [Apoorva Agrawal](https://github.com/imApoorva36) ([+91 8197404580](https://wa.me/8197404580)), [Mardav Gandhi](https://github.com/marcdhi) ([+91 9033398366](https://wa.me/9033398366))

Difficulty: `Easy/Medium`

### Description

Develop a fun and interactive app where users input text, and it automatically translates the message into emoji-based sentences. The app will primarily use a predefined dictionary to map words or phrases to corresponding emojis. Users will also have the ability to tweak the emoji translations manually by selecting from a list of alternative emojis.

_Because sometimes, the right emoji speaks louder than words!_

Follow the steps below to complete this challenge:

1. Develop a simple user interface (UI) that allows users to input text (e.g., a sentence or phrase)
2. Create a predefined dictionary that maps common words or phrases to emojis
3. Once the user enters a sentence, break it down into individual words and replace the words that have corresponding emojis with the emojis
4. After the initial translation, allow users to manually tweak the suggested emojis by selecting from a list of alternative options
5. Also add a Voice-to-Emoji Translation with integrated voice recognition so that users can speak their sentences, and the app translates them into emojis in real-time. This will add a fun element to the app

Bonus Feature ( Optional ):

_Implementing the bonus feature will make the task count as `Medium`, otherwise it will be `Easy`_

1. Emoji Sentiment Analysis having an implementation of sentiment analysis using simple NLP models (like VADER or TextBlob) to adjust emoji suggestions based on the emotional tone of the text. This can help ensure the emoji translation better reflects the mood of the original message

### Expected Input and Output Examples:

`Input: "I love pizza"`

Output: "‚ù§Ô∏è üçï"

`Input: "The dog is happy"`

Output: "üê∂ üòÉ"

- [Sentiment Analysis NLP Library](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)
- [ReactJS](https://react.dev/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)

### Tips

1. Start by focusing on a basic set of words for translation and expand the emoji dictionary over time.
2. Make the UI fun and interactive with features like live emoji preview as the user types.
3. Consider using libraries or frameworks like React, Vue.js, or plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript for building the interface.
4. Allow flexibility in how emojis are displayed and edited, making the user experience more enjoyable.

## Task ID: Web-Based Diagram Generator

#### Full-Stack Development, Diagram Generation, Graphviz

Mentors: [Udit Jain](https://github.com/UditJain2622004) ([+91 8708596606](https://wa.me/918708596606)), [Shubham Subodh Rasal](https://github.com/Shubham-Rasal) ([+91 7349784770](https://wa.me/917349784770))

Difficulty: `Medium`

### Description

Develop a web application inspired by `Mermaid.js` that enables users to generate various types of diagrams based on user input. Users can enter data or upload relevant files, and the system will produce the desired diagram. Focus on letting users generate diagrams with minimal input. The application should also provide the option to export the generated diagram in popular formats like PNG and PDF.

Some Popular Diagram Types your application _may_ support:

- Flowcharts
- ER Diagrams
- Class Diagrams
- Dependency Diagrams (for Node.js/React projects)

**Note :** The type and number of diagram(s) your application support is not fixed. You are free to implement support for any type and number of diagram(s). The diagrams given above are just some examples.

#### Steps:

1. **Input Mechanism**: Design a simple input system that is intuitive and allows for diagram creation, whether through form-based inputs or file uploads.
2. **Diagram Generation**:
   - Implement support for creating diagram using **Graphviz** or **D3.js**.
   - For Dependency Diagrams for Node.js/React projects, allow users to upload a zip file of the project. The tool should parse the project‚Äôs dependencies and visualize the relationship between files and external packages.
3. **Export Functionality**: Provide an option for users to export their diagrams in popular formats like PNG or PDF.

### Useful Resources:

- [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org)
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
- [Mermaid.js Documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/)
- [Dependency Graphs in Software Projects](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-ls)

### Tips

1. Build support for different types of diagrams one by one.
2. Use project analysis tools like npm, yarn, or Webpack to generate dependency graphs for Node.js and React projects. These tools can help map out the project structure automatically.
3. Leverage libraries like Graphviz or D3.js for creating clean and user-friendly visualizations. These libraries are flexible and can handle a wide range of diagram types.
4. Focus on the user experience by ensuring that users can generate diagrams with the least amount of manual effort. Implement features like pre-filled options where possible.

### Task ID: Fast-Type

#### `Web Development`,`Frontend`,`Backend`,`WebSockets`

Mentors: [Aahil Rafiq](https://github.com/AahilRafiq) ([+91 7975657621](https://wa.me/917975657621)), [Shree Harsha Bhat](https://github.com/mshreeharsha) ([+91 9739835034](https://wa.me/919739835034))

Difficulty: `Medium`

### Description

Build a typing speed test app like [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/). The app should let users take a typing test based on either time (e.g., 60 seconds) or a fixed number of words (e.g., 50 words).

Include the following features:

1. Show the typing speed (words per minute) and accuracy after the test.
2. Provide analytics on the user's typing:
   - Speed and accuracy stats
   - A graph showing how typing speed changes over time during the test
3. Create a daily leaderboard and an all-time leaderboard to display the top typers.
4. See that frontend provides a good user experience, including real-time updating of letters typed , correct marking of letters and good looking UI.
5. **Bonus:** Show how a user's typing speed improves over time.
6. **Bonus:** Add a multiplayer mode where users can race with 5 random people online.

### Useful resources:

- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
- [SpeedTypingOnline (How to calculate WPM and accuracy)](https://www.speedtypingonline.com/typing-equations)
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)

### Tips

1. Start with a basic typing test that records speed and accuracy.
2. For leaderboards, use a simple database to store results and calculate rankings.
3. For the graph, use Chart.js to visualize typing speed over time.

## Task ID: AgriVerify

#### `Web Application`, `Blockchain`, `Smart Contracts`

Mentors: [Krishna Tulsyan](https://github.com/krishna) ([+91 9506221135](https://wa.me/9506221135)), [Apoorva Agrawal](https://github.com/imApoorva36) ([+91 8197404580](https://wa.me/8197404580)), [Mardav Gandhi](https://github.com/marcdhi) ([+91 9033398366](https://wa.me/9033398366))

Difficulty: `Medium/Hard`

### Description

**AgriVerify**, where you'll blend blockchain technology with organic farming to bring trust and transparency to every crop grown! In this task, you‚Äôll be creating a decentralized platform that empowers farmers to easily certify their organic produce and generate QR codes that consumers can scan for instant verification.

Imagine walking through a market, scanning a QR code on an apple, and instantly seeing its certification, the farm it came from, and the people behind it‚Äîall with the power of blockchain!

---

### Steps to Complete the Challenge:

1. **Farmer Onboarding:**  
   Build a welcoming system where farmers can easily sign up using wallet authentication and request certification for their crops. The process should be seamless, ensuring the user experience is as simple as organic farming itself.

2. **Certification Process:**  
   Dive into smart contracts! Implement a contract where farmers submit their crops for certification. For simplicity, assume the certifications are auto-approved. The goal is transparency and accessibility.

3. **QR Code Generation:**  
   Generate QR codes for certified crops. These codes should link to a beautifully simple page showing the certification details stored on the blockchain, enabling consumers to instantly trust their food.

---

### Bonus Task:

**Note**: Attempting this section will consider your submission as a `hard task`.

**Push Notifications:**  
Add an extra touch by integrating **[Push Protocol](https://push.org/)** to notify farmers in real-time when their crops are certified. Keep them excited and informed with instant updates!

---
**Note**: You can team up with others to complete this task, but remember, the interview will be conducted individually.
